		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<h2>What is the website about?</h2>
		<p>My website will be a website for a new, made-up Italian restaurant. It will include a homepage, an about page, a menu page, and a page to leave a review. The styling will roughly be modeled after the 
		   website for Il Camino in Leominster, which can be found <a href="https://ilcamino-restaurant.com/">here</a></p>
        
		<h2>What is its purpose?</h2>
		<p>The purpose of my website will be to give vital information about the restaurant and give customers an opportunity to share their thoughts and experience.</p>
		
		<h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
		<p>The target audience of my website will be restaurant-goers who want to know more about the restaurant before coming.</p>
		
		<h2>What does the target audience want from the website?</h2>
		<p>The target audience would want ease of access and a clear layout of the website. Nothing should be too difficult for the user to understand, and all information, such as prices, should be clear.</p>
    
		<h1>Competitive Research</h1>
		<h2>Are there other websites on your topic?</h2>
		<p>There are plenty of other websites on this topic, because every Italian restaurant likely has its own website!</p>
		
		<h2>What are other sites doing? What are they successful at? What are they unsuccessful at?</h2>
		<p>Looking at the websites for five different restaurants, they all have sections for the menu, and most of them offered catering and an hours/location section on their website. It didn't really seem 
		   like their was any website that did anything particularly different than any other website.</p>

		<h2>How can your site be better or different than the competitors?</h2>
		<p>A feature I could put on my website which would set it apart from the rest is having a "Meet the Staff" page. No site that I saw had this, and I feel like it's important, especially in the times 
			we're living in, to recognize all the people that make things run smoothly behind the scenes!</p>
			
		<p>All the websites that I looked at were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://ilcamino-restaurant.com/">Il Camino</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.il-forno.com/">Il Forno</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bertuccis.com/">Bertucci's</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://ilovelinguines.com/">Linguine's</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.antoniosbeaconhill.com/index.html">Antonio's</a></li>
		</ul>
