	<title>Project Report</title>
	<body>
		<p>My goal for this project was to make a restaurant website, and I believe the final product meets that goal. I dedicated one week to
			structuring with HTML, one week to styling with CSS, and one week to adding functionality with JavaScript. However, I did not follow
			this schedule exactly. I spent far more than a week with the HTML; I kept adding new features until the very end of the project, such
			as the music button. Fortunately, since I only had one style sheet, I did not need to spend long on it. Lastly, I did not complete the 
			JavaScript until late in the project, since for some reason the code in my script.js file was not working, even though the code worked
			when I embedded it into the HTML. </p>
			
		<p>My final project consists of six HTML files (two of which are simply forms) and one CSS file (as I previously stated, my script.js would 
			not cooperate). The file named restaurant.html is the equivalent of my index.html. If I decide in the future to come back to this 
			project to improve it, I will make sure my script.js works, and figure out a way to have the color button make the entire page green, 
			rather than have it done in stripes. I may also incorporate jQuery in the future; the reason I didn't on this project was simply time 
			restraints. </p>
			
		<p>For the pictures on the home page, I used a grid layout. I also made sure that the position of the navigation menu on top of the page
			was fixed, so that a user would continue to see it as they scrolled. I added a gif of the Italian flag waving behind the name of 
			the restaurant; initially, the image was repeating, so I had to style that differently. I also used the form validation methods from 
			the lecture notes on JavaScript. All the pictures I used throughout the project, including all the people on my Meet the Staff! page, 
			were stick photos taken from Google images.</p>
			
		<p>In conclusion, I learned so much from this project, and felt it to be a fitting wrap-up to everything we learned throughout the semester.
			I am very proud of my final project, and it has certainly piqued my interest in web development enough to want to play around with it for 
			my own personal enjoyment!</p>
